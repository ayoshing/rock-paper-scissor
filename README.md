# Rock-Paper-Scissors

## Gameplay
A pure luck-based run-of-the-mill rock-paper-scissors game against the computer.

The result of each round is indicated by a color glow surrounding your selection:

Green == win  
Red == lose  
Gray == draw

Subsequently, the score will be updated on the scoreboard following the result.

Game winner is determined by the first to win 5 rounds.

Good luck!
